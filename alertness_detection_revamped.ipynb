    "# Revamped Alertness‑Detection Pipeline\n",
    "Cut the fluff—this notebook rebuilds our alertness classifier from the ground up. We pull raw EEG, splice it into 30‑second epochs, weld on signal‑quality flags, sculpt a *real* feature set, and throw modern ML at the problem. The result: measurable, reproducible gains—or we rip it up and try again.\n",
